## Challenge 

Dot has a lot of different boxes laying around. They need a system for how to unpack them, or they'll just continue procrastinating. Help Dot sort the boxes by their weight.

| Box:  | Weight (kg) |
|-------|-------------|
| Box 1 | 4           |
| Box 2 | 2           |
| Box 3 | 18          |
| Box 4 | 21          |
| Box 5 | 14          |
| Box 6 | 13          |

**Create a function that will open the boxes according to their weight, from lightest to heaviest.**

## What I learned 

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relative_change_and_difference

A percentage change is a way to express a change in a variable. It represents the relative change between the old value and the new one.

If a bank were to raise the interest rate on a savings account from 3% to 4%, the statement that "the interest rate was increased by 1%" is ambiguous and should be avoided. The absolute change in this situation is 1 percentage point (4% âˆ’ 3%), but the relative change in the interest rate is:

4% - 3% / 3 % = 0.333... = 33 1/3 %

So, one should say either that the interest rate was increased by 1 percentage point, or that the interest rate was increased by 33 1/3 %.

In general, the term "percentage point(s)" indicates an absolute change or difference of percentages, while the percent sign or the word "percentage" refers to the relative change or difference.
